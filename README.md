# IIT-Guwahati-Project_work-
This Repo comprise my all work and project which i done in my last Organization at IIT Guwahati. it consist Object detection project with results and another python projects


About the Project: 
My project focused on exploring underwater aquatic life and identifying fish species (like jellyfish and eels) for research purposes. First, we developed an underwater vehicle and designed a custom control system. Following that, I trained an object detection model using a dataset of three thousand images. This dataset included images of three different classes of fish, captured from multiple angles and orientations. I used the YOLOv8 model and trained it using TensorFlow. Before training, I performed data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering for marine life surveillance. For this preprocessing, I utilized libraries like Pandas, MySQL, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Finally, I deployed the model on a Raspberry Pi 4. The model achieved an accuracy of over 93 percent.
