# # #####################  A blueprint of the coffee machine project and its requirements ##########################

# 1. Ask from user for coffee type by prompting:
#     "what would you like to have?(latte/espresso/cappuccino)"   # it should be in loop as it will ask again and again
#     Once the drink is dispence this prompt should be show to serve the next customer.
# 2. When user enters "report"as an input then a report should be generated that shows
#    the current resource value:
#        exmaple: water = 200ml
#        milk = 50ml
#        coffee = 75g
#        money = Rs. 1500
# 3. If the user enter "off" as input then your program should end execution.
# 4. Check sufficient resource are available or not?
# 5. If sufficient resource are available then machine should ask to insert coins and calculate total money received
#    [Coffee Machine only accept 5rs. 10rs. and 20rs. coins]
# 6. Check payment is successful or not
#    if user has entered sufficient money, the cost of drink gets added to the machine as a profit.
#    if user has entered too much money, machine should offer change to the user.
#    and if the money is not sufficient to purchase the drink user has selected, it should print a message
#     "Sorry, that's not enough money. Money refunded"
# 7. Make coffee
#    if payment is successful, ingredient to make the selected drink should be deducted from the coffee machine resource.
#    and it will print the bill. and message "Here is your e.g. cappuccino"
